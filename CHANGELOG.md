# Changelog

## v0.2.3

* Bug fixes
  * Check minimum Qt version to avoid supporting Chromium/Qt issues that have
    been fixed
  * Improve default home page to give more things to try.

## v0.2.2

* Bug fixes
  * Capture output to stderr from Chromium and the kiosk port app and send it to
    the logger. Previously that output would get lost if you didn't have a
    serial console cable attached making it difficult to get diagnotic logs.
  * Add `:run_as_root` option get past uid/gid checks if this is something that
    you'd like to try. This is not recommended and has not identified an issue
    so far.

## v0.2.1

* Bug fixes
  * Report web page crashes. When pages crash, Chromium handles them by printing
    to the console and doing nothing. Now there's a message that gets propogated
    up to Elixir and logged. The browser returns home.

## v0.2.0

* Bug fixes
  * Fixed Raspberry Pi/Chromium/Qt bug that caused touch events to be lost when
    there's a network connection, but no Internet.
  * Improve handling of C++ code exits

* New features
  * Support running under a non-root account. This is required now.
  * Improve default homepage
  * Add `set_zoom/2` to change the zoom level
  * Add helpers for setting permissions on the Raspberry Pi. Ideally these would
    move out of this project, but they're too convenient for now.

## v0.1.0
